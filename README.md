## Building Progressive Web Applications

A progressive web application, often called a PWA, is a type of application built using common web technologies including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is intended to work on any platform that uses a standards-compliant browser, including both desktop and mobile devices. PWA’s offer fast performance, access to mobile device sensors, support push notifications, and the ability to download the app to a mobile home screen, making them a great choice for your next application.

In this path you will gain an overview of what PWA’s are and why they might be a good choice for your next app. You will then learn how to build and design a PWA while diving into service workers and performance. After learning how to publish a PWA you will learn about common testing and debugging tools to keep your up running efficiently and up to date.
